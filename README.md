      2.Data contains summary of review statement by customers through various portals.
      
# Step by Step Process:
      1.Cleaning the data and defining corpus
      2.Pipeline model build
      3.Training and Evaluation

# Key Note:
     1.Eventhough the model is giving good metrics,its performance is not up to the mark.The Model should be developed with DL algorithms such as LSTM and RNN.
     2.Sooner, the phase 2 of work is updated.
